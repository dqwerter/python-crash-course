# Python Crash Course

## Requisite: pygame

Install: `python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user`

_Note_: Issues could occur if you use brew or conda installed python on macOS 10.14, such as no content inside window 
(or invisible screen object in pygame). To fix this, try to install another python from `python.org`.
